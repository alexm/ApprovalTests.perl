Although modules exist which allow this\r\nkind of testing, ApprovalTests really shines when you need a more\r\ngranular look at the test failure.  Sometimes, trying to find a small\r\ndifference in a long string printed to STDOUT is just too hard!  \r\nApprovalTests solves this problem by providing reporters which let you\r\nview the test results in one of many popular diff utilities.\r\n\r\n#INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nFrom CPAN ( http://search.cpan.org/~jrcounts/Test-Approvals/ ):\r\n\r\n\tcpan install Test::Approvals\r\n\r\nFrom PPM ( http://code.activestate.com/ppm/Test-Approvals/ ):\r\n\r\n\tppm install Test::Approvals\r\n\r\nFrom source:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/approvals/Perl-Test-Approvals.git\r\n\tcd Perl-Test-Approvals\r\n\tperl Build.PL\r\n\t./Build\r\n\t./Build test\r\n\t./Build install\r\n\r\n#SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nAfter installing, you can find documentation for this module with the\r\nperldoc command.\r\n\r\n    perldoc Test::Approvals\r\n\r\nYou can also look for information at:\r\n\r\n    GitHub \r\n        https://github.com/approvals/Perl-Test-Approvals\r\n\r\n    ApprovalTests Homepage\r\n        http://www.approvaltests.com\r\n        \r\n#LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Jim Counts\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
